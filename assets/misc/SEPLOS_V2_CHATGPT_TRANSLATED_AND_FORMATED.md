## I. Communication Instructions

The EMU11XX series of BMS products communicate with FSU, PC, or other upper controllers via RS485, using the MODBUS ASCII communication protocol as per the YD/T1363.3 specification.

### 1.1 Interface Setting

- EMU11XX series of BMS products use asynchronous serial communication interfaces.
- Start bit: 1
- Data bit: 8
- Stop bit: 1
- Check bit: None
- Default data transmission rate: 9600 BPS.

### 1.2 Interface Connection

Note: A 120â„¦ terminal matching resistor should be added to the starting and final points of the communication connection respectively.

### 1.3 Connection Mode

The communication between the supervision unit (SU) and the supervision module (SM) is a point-to-multipoint master-slave mode. SU calls SM using BMS DIP addresses:

- BMS DIP address 1
- BMS DIP address 2
- BMS DIP address 3
- ...
- BMS DIP address 15

SU issues commands to the called SM at the corresponding address, and the SM receives the command and returns the response information. If SU does not receive the response information from SM within 500ms or receives the wrong response information, the communication process is considered to have failed.

## II. Information Structure

Information is organized in a structured manner for correct transmission between SU and SM. Refer to Table 1 for information structure. Information is composed of multiple bytes, where one or more bytes form a unit, each having a name that represents its defined meaning. Additional details about the units in Table 1 can be found in Table 2. Furthermore, Table 3 provides comments on CID1 in Table 2, while Table 4 and Table 5 offer further comments on CID2 in Table 2.
